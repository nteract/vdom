Oh, hello there! You're probably reading this because you are interested in
contributing to vdom. That's great to hear! This document will help you
through your journey of open source. Love it, cherish it, take it out to
dinner, but most importantly: read it thoroughly!

## What do I need to know to help?

### JavaScript side

You'll need knowledge of JavaScript (ES6), React, RxJS, Redux, and Flow to help out
with this project. That's a whole lot of cool stuff! But don't worry, we've
got some resources to help you out.
* [Building a voting app with Redux and React](http://teropa.info/blog/2015/09/10/full-stack-redux-tutorial.html)
* [Introduction to Reactive Programming](https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754)
* [Examples, Explanations, and Resources for RxJS 5](https://github.com/btroncone/learn-rxjs)
* [Adding Flow to React Components](https://flowtype.org/docs/react.html#defining-components-as-reactcomponent-subclasses)

### Jupyter and ZeroMQ (Optional)

While not a strict pre-requisite, familiarity with the protocol that Jupyter
provides for creating rich notebooks like nteract (and other consoles/REPLs) is
advised to understand the overall system.

* [Jupyter Messaging](http://jupyter-client.readthedocs.org/en/latest/messaging.html)
* [ZeroMQ](http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all)

If you want a gentle guide to Rx + Jupyter messaging at the same time, we have
a [build your own REPL with enchannel](https://github.com/nteract/docs/blob/master/enchannel/build-your-own-repl.md) tutorial. This allows you to work without React while learning concepts, leading to implementing a light version of [ick](https://github.com/nteract/ick),
an interactive console.

## How do I make a contribution?

Never made an open source contribution before? Wondering how contributions work
in the nteract world? Here's a quick rundown!

1. Find an issue that you are interested in addressing or a feature that you
would like to address.
2. Fork the repository associated with the issue to your local GitHub organization.
3. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone
https://github.com/github-username/repository-name.git`.
4. Install the project editably with all the dependencies `pip install -e .[all]`
5. Create a new branch for your fix using `git checkout -b branch-name-here`.
6. Make the appropriate changes for the issue you are trying to address or the
feature that you want to add.
7. Confirm that unit tests pass successfully with `py.test`. If tests fail, don't hesitate to ask for help.
8. Add and commit the changed files using `git add` and `git commit`.
9. Push the changes to the remote repository using `git push origin
branch-name-here`.
10. Submit a pull request to the upstream repository.
11. Title the pull request per the requirements outlined in the section below.
12. Set the description of the pull request with a brief description of what you
did and any questions you might have about what you did.
13. Wait for the pull request to be reviewed by a maintainer.
14. Make changes to the pull request if the reviewing maintainer recommends them.
15. Celebrate your success after your pull request is merged! :tada:

## How should I write my commit messages and PR titles?

Good commit messages serve at least three important purposes:

* To speed up the reviewing process.

* To help us write good release notes.

* To help the future maintainers of nteract/vdom (it could be you!),
say five years into the future, to find out why a particular change was made to
the code or why a specific feature was added.

Structure your commit message in an imperative present tense like this:

> ```
> create elements for each of the svg tags
> ```

or

> ```
> disallow null elements when the sky is blue
> ```

You can write much longer explanatory text after the "main" commit message, as
described in [[http://git-scm.com/book/ch5-2.html]]

> ```
> Short (50 chars or less) summary of changes
>
> More detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Wrap it to about 72
> characters or so.  In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
> subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body.  The blank
> line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
> the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run the
> two together.
>
> Further paragraphs come after blank lines.
>
>   - Bullet points are okay, too
>
>   - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded by a
>     single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions vary here
> ```


### DO

* Write the summary line and description of what you have done in the imperative
mode, that is as if you were commanding. Start the line with "Fix", "Add",
"Change" instead of "Fixed", "Added", "Changed".
* Always leave the second line
blank.
* Line break the commit message (to make the commit message readable
without having to scroll horizontally in gitk).

### DON'T

* Don't end the summary line with a period - it's a title and titles don't end
with a period.

### Tips

* If it seems difficult to summarize what your commit does, it may be because it
includes several logical changes or bug fixes, and are better split up into
several commits using `git add -p`.

### References

The following blog post has a nice discussion of commit messages:

## How fast will my PR be merged?

Your pull request will be merged as soon as there are maintainers to review it and
after tests have passed. You might have to make some changes before your PR is merged
but as long as you adhere to the steps above and try your best, you should have no problem
getting your PR merged.

That's it! You're good to go!
